# Overview

This project presents a comprehensive study of the Chernoff Bound, covering its origin, key properties, and a comparison with Markov and Chebyshev bounds. It includes a proof of Hoeffding’s Lemma and demonstrates applications through simulation studies. The focus is on both understanding the theory and observing its behavior empirically.

# Features

- Explains the origin and motivation behind the Chernoff Bound.
- Highlights key properties and advantages over classical bounds (Markov and Chebyshev).
- Provides a detailed proof of Hoeffding’s Lemma.
- Compares different bounds with simulations to validate behavior.
